# Calendar and Workload Database Updates

## Database Schema Changes

1. **Added Calendar Events Table**
   - Created a new `calendar_events` table to store user calendar events
   - Fields include:
     - `id`: UUID primary key
     - `user_id`: Reference to the user who owns the event
     - `title`: Event title
     - `description`: Event description
     - `start_time`: Event start time
     - `end_time`: Event end time
     - `all_day`: Boolean flag for all-day events
     - `type`: Event type (meeting, ooo, busy, focus, available, etc.)
     - `status`: Event status (confirmed, tentative, cancelled)
     - `location`: Event location
     - `is_recurring`: Boolean flag for recurring events
     - `recurrence_rule`: Rule for recurring events
     - `visibility`: Privacy setting (private, public)

2. **Added Indexes**
   - Created indexes on `user_id`, `start_time`, and `end_time` for better query performance
   - This ensures calendar queries are fast even with many events

## Database Functions

1. **Calendar Event Functions**
   - `getCalendarEvents`: Retrieves events for a user within a date range
   - `createCalendarEvent`: Creates a new calendar event
   - `updateCalendarEvent`: Updates an existing calendar event
   - `deleteCalendarEvent`: Deletes a calendar event
   - `getTeammateEvents`: Retrieves public events for teammates

2. **Data Transformation**
   - Added transformation between database format and component format
   - Ensures consistent data structure throughout the application

## Performance Improvements

1. **Debounced Calendar Loading**
   - Added debouncing to prevent excessive database calls when navigating
   - Calendar data now loads with a 300ms delay after navigation stops
   - This prevents the calendar from refreshing repeatedly when using arrow keys

2. **Optimized Navigation Functions**
   - Updated navigation functions to use functional updates
   - This ensures state updates are based on the latest state value
   - Prevents race conditions when navigating quickly

## Mock Data Support

1. **Added Mock Calendar Data**
   - Provided mock calendar events for development without a database
   - Ensures the application works even when Supabase is unavailable

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Recurring Events**
   - The database schema supports recurring events, but the UI implementation is pending
   - This will allow users to create events that repeat on a schedule

2. **Add Calendar Sharing**
   - Enhance the teammate calendar view to support more granular sharing options
   - Allow users to share specific calendars with teammates

3. **Implement Calendar Integrations**
   - Add support for importing/exporting calendar data from external sources
   - Integrate with popular calendar services
