# Calendar Component Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Calendar Refresh/Flickering Issue**
   - **Problem**: The calendar was refreshing and flickering every time an arrow key was pressed for navigation
   - **Root Cause**: The calendar was re-rendering and reloading data immediately after each state change
   - **Solution**:
     - Implemented proper memoization using `useMemo` and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary recalculations
     - Added a navigation flag to prevent data loading during navigation
     - Used refs to track navigation state and prevent multiple simultaneous data loads
     - Separated date calculations from data loading to reduce unnecessary work

2. **Event Saving Issue**
   - **Problem**: Unable to save events to the calendar
   - **Root Cause**: Mismatch between the event object structure in the dialog and the expected structure in the database
   - **Solution**:
     - Updated the event object in `CalendarEventDialog` to match the database schema
     - Fixed field names (`user_id` â†’ `userId`, etc.)
     - Added missing required fields (`status`, `location`, `visibility`)
     - Improved error handling to provide better feedback

## Technical Improvements

1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Memoized date calculations to prevent recalculation on every render
   - Memoized date range text to prevent string formatting on every render
   - Created a stable callback for loading calendar data
   - Used refs to prevent unnecessary effect triggers

2. **State Management**
   - Added navigation state tracking to prevent data loading during navigation
   - Implemented proper cleanup for timeouts to prevent memory leaks
   - Used functional updates for state to ensure the latest state is used

3. **User Experience**
   - Eliminated flickering during navigation
   - Reduced unnecessary API calls
   - Improved error handling and feedback

## How It Works Now

1. **Navigation**
   - When a navigation button is clicked, a flag is set to indicate navigation is in progress
   - The date state is updated using a functional update to ensure the latest state
   - After a short delay, the flag is cleared and data is loaded once
   - This prevents multiple data loads during rapid navigation

2. **Data Loading**
   - Data loading is debounced to prevent excessive API calls
   - Date calculations are memoized to prevent unnecessary work
   - Data is only loaded when navigation is complete

3. **Event Creation**
   - The event object structure now matches the database schema
   - All required fields are included
   - Error handling provides clear feedback on issues

## Import Conflict Resolution

We encountered and resolved an import naming conflict in the Dashboard component:

1. **Issue**: The `Calendar` identifier was imported twice:
   - Once as an icon from 'lucide-react'
   - Once as a component from './Calendar'

2. **Solution**: Renamed the Lucide React Calendar icon import to `CalendarIcon` to avoid the conflict:
   ```javascript
   import { 
     // other imports...
     Calendar as CalendarIcon 
   } from 'lucide-react';
   ```

3. **Updates**: Updated all references to the Calendar icon in the component:
   ```javascript
   <CalendarIcon className="h-3 w-3 mr-1" />
   ```

## Database Integration

1. **Database Schema**
   - Created `calendar_events` table with fields for:
     - Event details (title, description, location)
     - Timing information (start, end, all_day)
     - Categorization (type, status)
     - Visibility settings
     - User associations

2. **Database Functions**
   - Implemented `getCalendarEvents` to fetch events within a date range
   - Added `createCalendarEvent` for adding new events
   - Created `updateCalendarEvent` for modifying existing events
   - Implemented `deleteCalendarEvent` for removing events
   - Added `getTeammateEvents` to view teammate schedules

3. **Error Handling**
   - Enhanced error logging in database functions
   - Added proper error messages for failed operations
   - Implemented validation before database operations

## Next Steps

1. **Test Calendar Functionality**:
   - Navigate to the Dashboard
   - Click on the "Calendar" tab
   - Try adding events and switching between views
   - Test teammate schedule visibility

2. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Event editing and deletion UI
   - Recurring events support
   - Calendar sharing and external calendar integration
   - Email/notification reminders
   - Drag-and-drop event creation and modification

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the calendar feature:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify that the database connection is working properly
3. Ensure that the event object structure matches the database schema
4. Check that the Calendar component is correctly imported in the Dashboard
5. Verify that the navigation state is being properly managed

## Development Status

The development server is currently running. You can access the application at http://localhost:3000 to test the calendar functionality with the fixes implemented.
