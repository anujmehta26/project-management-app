# Next Steps for Project Management App

## Recent Changes Made

1. **Fixed ES Module Issues**:
   - Removed `"type": "module"` from `package.json` to revert to CommonJS format
   - Updated `next.config.js` to use ES module export syntax
   - Installed the `dotenv` package for environment variable management

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Created a `.env` file with placeholders for Supabase credentials

## Required Next Steps

1. **Complete Supabase Configuration**:
   - Update the `.env` file with your actual Supabase credentials:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_actual_supabase_url
     SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_actual_service_role_key
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key
     ```

2. **Run Database Migrations**:
   - After updating the `.env` file, run:
     ```
     node src/lib/migrations/run_migrations.js
     ```
   - This will create the necessary tables for calendar events

3. **Test Calendar Functionality**:
   - Verify that you can create, view, update, and delete calendar events
   - Check that the monthly view fits within the screen and is scrollable
