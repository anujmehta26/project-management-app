# Shadcn UI Consistency Implementation

## What Was Done

We've updated the UI components to use consistent shadcn styling while maintaining the existing colors and functionality. The following changes were made:

### 1. Component Updates

- **Button Component**: Updated to use shadcn's button styling with your existing blue color scheme
- **Card Component**: Enhanced with proper border styling and consistent spacing
- **Input Component**: Improved with better focus states and consistent sizing
- **Select Component**: Updated with better dropdown styling and consistent focus states
- **Dialog Component**: Enhanced with animations and better overlay styling
- **Alert Dialog Component**: Updated to use the button variants for actions
- **TaskForm Component**: Improved spacing and layout consistency

### 2. Styling Consistency

- Added proper spacing between form elements
- Ensured consistent focus states across all interactive elements
- Maintained your existing color scheme while using shadcn's component architecture
- Improved dark mode support across all components

### 3. Import Path Fixes

- Updated import paths to use the correct relative paths
- Ensured all components are importing from the same location

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Consistent UI**: All components now follow the same design patterns and styling conventions
2. **Better Accessibility**: Improved focus states and interactive elements
3. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing functionality remains intact
4. **Improved Dark Mode**: Better support for dark mode across all components

## How to Use These Components

When building new features, follow these guidelines:

1. **Import Components**: Use the correct import paths
   ```javascript
   import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
   import { Card, CardContent } from '@/components/ui/card'
   ```

2. **Form Layout**: Use consistent spacing in forms
   ```jsx
   <div className="space-y-2">
     <Label htmlFor="fieldName">Field Label</Label>
     <Input id="fieldName" />
   </div>
   ```

3. **Button Variants**: Use the appropriate button variants
   ```jsx
   <Button variant="default">Primary Action</Button>
   <Button variant="outline">Secondary Action</Button>
   <Button variant="destructive">Delete</Button>
   ```

4. **Card Structure**: Use the proper card component structure
   ```jsx
   <Card>
     <CardHeader>
       <CardTitle>Card Title</CardTitle>
       <CardDescription>Card description</CardDescription>
     </CardHeader>
     <CardContent>
       Content goes here
     </CardContent>
     <CardFooter>
       Footer content
     </CardFooter>
   </Card>
   ```

## Next Steps

To further enhance the UI consistency:

1. Update any remaining components to use the shadcn styling
2. Consider adding more shadcn components as needed
3. Ensure all new features follow these design patterns
